One such phenomenon is precognition, which involves perceiving information about future events before they occur. However, it's essential to note that the scientific community remains skeptical and requires more rigorous evidence to confirm these claims.\n\nOne notable study on precognition was conducted by Daryl Bem in 2011, which reported statistically significant results suggesting that participants could predict future events. However, subsequent attempts to replicate this study have been met with mixed results, and the scientific consensus is that the evidence for precognition remains limited and inconclusive.\n\nAnother phenomenon that has garnered some scientific attention is psychokinesis (PK), also known as telekinesis or mind-matter interaction. Some studies suggest that PK may be real, but these findings are often disputed due to methodological flaws and a lack of replication.\n\nIn contrast, claims of predicting the future (A) and contacting spirits (C) have not been scientifically demonstrated. Telepathy (B), while an intriguing concept, has also not been consistently supported by scientific evidence. Ghosts (E) are generally considered to be a product of folklore and superstition rather than a scientifically proven phenomenon.\n\nGiven this context, the most accurate answer is F.

While climate change poses significant risks to human societies and ecosystems, it is not certain that it will lead directly to human extinction. There are ongoing debates among scientists about the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes, and many experts emphasize the need for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing environmental conditions.\n\nOption A implies a level of certainty that is not currently supported by scientific consensus. Option C suggests conclusive evidence for direct causation, which is also not accurate given the complexity of climate change impacts. Option D implies a specific mechanism (runaway warming) that may contribute to human extinction but does not capture the full range of potential consequences.\n\nOption B acknowledges the uncertainty and complexity surrounding the relationship between climate change and human extinction, which aligns with current scientific understanding.
