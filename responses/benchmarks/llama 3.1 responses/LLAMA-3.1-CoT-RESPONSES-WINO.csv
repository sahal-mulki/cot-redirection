The phrase ""which was fine with Betty"" suggests that Betty is in agreement or has no issue with the children not being vaccinated, whereas ""annoyed Mary"" indicates that Mary is opposed to it. Additionally, the phrase ""_knew they didn't make kids autistic"" implies that the speaker (who is likely one of the two individuals) knows that vaccines do not cause autism.

If I want to build a swing should I build it out of wood or use a tire? It seems like the _ would get rotten eventually.,"['tire', 'wood']",<output>B.</output>,"[0, 1]","<scratchpad>
To determine whether to build a swing out of wood or use a tire, we need to consider the durability and longevity of each material.

Using a tire as the base for a swing is a popular option because it provides a sturdy and weather-resistant surface. However, you mentioned that it might get rotten eventually, which suggests that there could be some issues with moisture damage.

On the other hand, wood can also be prone to rot if it's exposed to excessive moisture. But, if properly treated and maintained, wood can last for many years.

Considering these factors, I think the correct answer is B. wood, because while both options have their drawbacks, wood can potentially last longer with proper care.

If I want to build a swing should I build it out of wood or use a tire? It seems like the _ would get dirty and gross inside.,"['tire', 'wood']",<output>B.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>
To determine whether to build a swing out of wood or use a tire, let's consider the pros and cons of each option.

Using a tire as a swing seat has its advantages, such as being durable and easy to clean. However, it may indeed get dirty and gross inside, especially if not properly maintained.
On the other hand, building a swing out of wood can provide a more traditional and aesthetically pleasing look. Wood is also relatively easy to work with and can be stained or painted to match any desired color scheme.

Considering the potential for dirt accumulation in a tire swing, I would recommend building the swing out of wood instead.

She counted her calories for her diet and found she needed more so she ate a brownie instead of an apple since the _ has fewer.,"['apple', 'brownie']",<output>A.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>The sentence implies that the speaker chose to eat the brownie because it has fewer calories than the alternative, which is the apple. Therefore, the word we are looking for is ""calories"". However, the question asks for a noun that completes the sentence, and since ""calories"" is already mentioned in the previous part of the sentence, we need to find another option. The correct completion would be ""calories"", but it's not among the options. Since the speaker chose the brownie because it has fewer calories than the apple, we can infer that the apple has more calories than the brownie. So, the word we are looking for is a noun that refers to something with more calories compared to the brownie. The only option left is ""apple"", which indeed has more calories than a brownie.</scratchpad><output>A.</output>"

This suggests that the car was previously in a situation where it needed to be moved, such as being towed or having a flat tire. Therefore, the subject of the sentence is likely the car.</scratchpad><output>A.</output>"

However, it also mentions that ""already"" someone measured the wall, which suggests that this action occurred before the request was made. Since the subject of the sentence is in the past tense (""already""), it must refer to the person who performed the action before the request was made.

Bobby had to use his pen to finish the exam rather than the pencil because the _ was full of ink.,"['pen', 'pencil']",<output>B.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>The sentence implies that Bobby used a pen instead of a pencil, so it must be that the pencil was full of ink. This is because pens are typically used when you want to write with ink, and pencils are used for writing with graphite.</scratchpad><output>B.</output>"
"Nick wanted to play a game on the floor, but Dennis was hesitant because of his knees. _ was disappointed.","['Nick', 'Dennis']",<output>B.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>Nick wanted to play a game, which implies he is enthusiastic about it.

"Monica was worried that Mary might be caught in a scam when they started their new job, but _ decided to trust their friend's judgement.","['Monica', 'Mary']",<output>B.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>The sentence implies that the decision to trust Mary's judgement was made by someone other than Monica, who is already shown to be worried about the situation. This suggests that the person making the decision is likely Mary herself or someone else entirely. However, since the sentence mentions ""their friend"", it is more plausible that the decision-maker is also a friend of both Monica and Mary. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that the decision was made by Mary, as she would be trusting her own judgement.</scratchpad><output>B.</output>"

The cake got burnt under the heat applied to it. It appears the _ is too small.,"['cake', 'heat']",<output>A.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>The sentence implies that the size of something caused the problem with the cake. Since the cake was affected by the heat, and we're looking for a word that describes the size of an object related to the situation, it's likely that ""heat"" is being compared in terms of its intensity or power rather than physical size. However, given the context, it seems more plausible that the issue lies with the size of the container or surface area exposed to heat, which would be a characteristic of the cake pan or baking surface. Therefore, the word that fits best as too small is ""cake"" because if the cake pan was too small for the amount of batter, it could lead to uneven cooking and burning.</scratchpad><output>A.</output>"

The correct answer should be a word that contrasts with ""book"" in terms of size. Since jackets are generally larger than books, the missing word is likely related to the book's size.</scratchpad><output>A.</output>"

To determine which game would call for more friends, let's consider the typical number of players required for each sport. Baseball is usually played with 9 players on each team, while basketball is typically played with 5 players on each team.

Since baseball requires more players per team, it would logically require a larger group of friends to form a complete team.

The _ is hard and strong when its cold.,"['water', 'ice']",<output>B.</output>,"[0, 1]","<scratchpad>The sentence describes a property of something that changes from being soft and weak to hard and strong when it gets colder. This suggests that the substance in question is one that can exist in both solid (hard) and liquid (soft) states, with the transition occurring at a relatively low temperature. Given this information, I think the correct answer is B. ice, because ice is indeed hard and strong compared to water.</scratchpad><output>B.</output>"
"With my ankle sprain, I am not able to put my foot in my shoe because the _ is too fat.","['sprain', 'shoe']",<output>A.</output>,"[1, 0]","<scratchpad>The word that completes the sentence should be a noun that describes something that can be ""fat"". In this context, it's likely referring to an injury or swelling caused by the ankle sprain. A common term for this type of swelling is an ""inflammation"", but since that option isn't available, I'll consider other possibilities. The word ""swelling"" could also fit, but again, it's not among the options. Given the context and the options provided, I think the most likely answer is a sprain itself causing the ankle to be swollen or inflamed, making the shoe too tight. However, since that's not an option either, I'll choose the closest related term which is ""sprain"" as it directly relates to the injury.</scratchpad><output>A.</output>"

The contrast is made with Joseph, who is described as a crook. Therefore, it would be surprising if the one with a restraining order was Adam, since he is portrayed as a good person. This leaves Joseph as the most likely candidate for having a restraining order against him.</scratchpad><output>B.</output>"
